## My process

My typical process involves reviewing the design files provided and then building out the components mobile-first, gradually adding styles for tablet and desktop views.

### Built with

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript superset
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - Utility-first CSS framework
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

During this project, I reinforced my skills in building responsive layouts and implementing a multi-page navigation structure with Next.js.

### Continued development

I plan to continue developing this project by:
- Implementing the remaining styles, such as the horizontal line in the navbar for the desktop view.
- Adding smooth animation effects. I am currently learning Framer Motion and intend to integrate animations as I progress.
